Python Remote Router Control

# Description

Some home routers allow telnet or ssh access to their functions, if we want to automate function or collect information from them this can be the easiest way. This library aims to enable a generic way to access these routers so it can work on many different routers. Initially it will be targetting the Draytek routers.
